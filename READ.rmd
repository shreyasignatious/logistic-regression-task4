 🧠 Task 4: Logistic Regression - Breast Cancer Classification

This project is part of my AI & ML Internship. The objective is to build a binary classifier using Logistic Regression to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.

## 🎯 Objective

- Build a binary classification model using Logistic Regression.
- Train, test, and evaluate the model using appropriate metrics.
- Visualize ROC-AUC and understand model performance.
- Practice working with real-world healthcare-related data.
